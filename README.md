# Full-Stack Restaurant Ordering & Management App

A comprehensive restaurant application built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. The project includes two distinct interfaces:

-  **Customer Interface** â€“ Browse menu, add to cart, checkout, and view order history.
- **Admin Dashboard** â€“ Manage menu, monitor orders, update statuses, and analyze performance.

---

##  Tech Stack

### Frontend (React.js)
- React.js with modular components
- React Router (`HashRouter`) for navigation (GitHub Pages support)
- Axios for REST API communication
- Bootstrap 5 + React Icons for responsive design

###  Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
- Express.js for building REST APIs
- MongoDB + Mongoose for database modeling
- JWT for secure admin login
- Nodemailer for sending order confirmation/completion emails
- dotenv for environment variable management

###  Deployment & CI/CD
- Frontend deployed on **GitHub Pages**
- Backend hosted on **Render**
- GitHub Actions used for **CI/CD pipelines**
